This was my first hackathon ever. I was foolish, I was hungry, and that was why I had fun.

I had zero coding background but they still had me on their team. The only coding contributions I did very well was commenting and documenting the code. But that's okay, because I had fun.

Here is a picture of us playing soccer with CDK's bouncy LED balls.
I joined this team because I wanted to have a great experience with my friends.
We took breaks. And when we took breaks, we had fun while we were at it!

And the result of all of our hardwork was first place! We won the Most-Civic Minded API Award.
