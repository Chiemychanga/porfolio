I am trying really hard not to tear up while writing this. I'm not trying to fry up my laptop. Here goes...

When I first came to PSU's CS department, I was a lost fish in the sea. I went to the tutoring lounge one night to work on my program and well behold, someone was watching the Seahawks football game in the computer lab. I met Scott Phon, an ACM member, who invited me to their meeting the next night.

The next day, I went to that meeting. And since then, they have taken me in and have made me apart of their family. I worked my way up and am now the 2016-2017 President of the ACM. I have bright hopes for the future of our club and our members.
