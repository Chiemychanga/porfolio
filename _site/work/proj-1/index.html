<p>HYPED: Hyped! Hype is a multiplatform responsive web app that its main goal is to create excitement and engagement toward an audience of sport enthusiasms. Allows them to get involved in small polls and raffles in the live game they are in now. Users will have access to the poll results as soon as they vote represented by material design charts.</p>

<p>This project was created at UOâ€™s 48-hour Quackcon in October 2016.

Here are two pictures of my team! During this hackathon, I learned how to use bootstrap for the first time. At first, I was having the hardest time understanding it and I momentarily felt like I was holding back my team. But I had to snap out of it and ask for help! That was my team helped me understand it and things just snapped. I was able to contribute something for my team.</p>

<p>Hackathons are always a great experience for me and it motivates me to compete! It was a blast and something that I will never forget.
