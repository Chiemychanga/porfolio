  <p>Strengths: Technical background, Problem-solver, Self-driven
  <p>Weaknesses: Need to work on my management skills, unfamiliar with the latest languages, being too critical of myself

  <p>3 Difficult situations:

  <p>I want to be a part of CDKâ€™s transformation and delivering long-term value for shareholders, clients and associates well into the future

  <p>I know that CDK Global is the largest global provider of integregated information technology and digital marketing solutions to the automtoive retail industry.
  <p>Knowing that, I was really intrigued by their video in their about me section. Their services handle from the moment buyers step on the lot to notifying owners about service checks, etc.
  <p>'C' Cobalt Digital Marketing
  <p>'D' Dealer Services
  <p>'K' represents Kerridge Computer Company to become a global provider.
